# Project Description

When the holidays or your birthday comes around it’s hard to remember the things that you have been wanting all year long. This mobile app will help solve this problem and allow you to keep track of what you want throughout the year. You can select and save specific items, available on various online stores, to a special Wishlist. You can then share the list with your friends and family so they know what to get you!

# Team

Looking for 2 other people to work on this project.

# SQL

We’re considering using either MySQL or AWS Aurora for a relational database.

# NoSQL

We’re considering using Firebase or AWS DynamoDB for a non-relational database. Both Firebase and DynamoDB support key-value and document based data structures.

# Business

Our business is simple. When an event comes around that involves gift giving, this is the app you need. First, search for items you want. Second, add them to your wishlist. Third, share with other people so they know what you want. Additional features can be added later, such as a buyer being able to let the recipient know if an item from their wishlist was purchased.

# Legal

This business will operate as a partnership. The following legal considerations are as follows:  Creating an account will be required to create and share a wishlist with others. However, information about what items you’ve viewed or added to your wishlist will be private and not shared with any third parties. All information associated with your account will be kept confidential. Users will have the option to share information about their lists to other specified users. The lists of other users will not be shown to you unless you accept their requests.

# Technical

Technical steps include:
1. Choosing a relational database and design the database schema
2. Building a front end client on a mobile platform
3. Building a back end server with technology yet to be determined
4. Putting together the MVP, which includes:
    - A simple display to search through any item for sale online and add to a specified list.
    - A display to view created lists and the details of items saved to that list
    - A way to view the lists of users that have connected with you
