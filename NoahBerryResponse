I am interested in joining this team because it sounds like a fun mobile app to work on. Having a central location to view items someone is wanting for an upcoming event seems to be in high demand. This project also looks like it will be a reasonable amount of work for the class. I think I can contribute by helping with the backend and database structure. Also if needs be, I can help with the front end as well.

Business: This is a great business proposal. It captures my attention and helps me to see the need for such an app. I couldnt have said it better myself.

Legal: I like the emphasis of privacy since that is such a huge thing in todays society. I wonder if there is an legality with advertising other companies products.

Technical: I like the MVP pattern and think it's a great idea for the front end. I am also a fan of MySQL and think it will be a great relational database to use. I hope we can talk more about NoSQL databases in the future when the time comes.
